Description
This is a calculator application, include an android app as client and a node.js server, in which android user interface sends operands to the node.js server via RESTful API, and the server return operation result to the client.

Server
1. Install node.js

2. Install libs
$ npm i -g npm
$ npm i --save lodash
$ npm i --save joi

3. Run RESTAPI on node.js
$ node cloud_plus.js

Client
1. Make sure that change IP to your server's IP address in code, because android disable "localhost" and "0.0.0.0"
   Mac: ifconfig
   Windows: ipconfig

2. If you got a ERR_CLEARTEXT_NOT_PERMITTED, because http is forbidden by Android 8.0 and later in default setting, in order to push switching to https
   if you want to use http request on Android, you should:
   1) add android:networkSecurityConfig in AndroidManifest.xml
      <application
          ...
          android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"

   2) xml/network_security_config:
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <network-security-config>
          <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true" />
      </network-security-config>

issues:
1. java.net.UnknownHostException: Unable to resolve host
   chrome in emulator is also unable to access internet
   possible solution:
   1) change dns to 8.8.8.8
   2) COLD BOOT emulator in AVD Manager
